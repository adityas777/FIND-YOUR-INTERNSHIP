🔍 FIND-YOUR-INTERNSHIP (AI-Powered Job Application Platform)
An AI-powered web application that helps users discover, tailor, and apply to the latest LinkedIn "Easy Apply" jobs—all with a swipe.

🚀 Features
🔄 Real-Time Job Fetching: Replaces stale job results by modifying LinkedIn URLs (e.g., r86400 ➝ r3600) to fetch the latest job postings.

📄 Resume Upload: Users can upload their resume (PDF/DOCX), which is parsed to extract relevant information.

🧠 AI Resume Tailoring: Resume is tailored to each job description using Groq LLM, enhancing skills, experience, and phrasing.

💼 LinkedIn Job Scraper: Scrapes job data including title, company, location, and requirements using Playwright and BeautifulSoup.

👉 Swipe to Apply: Users can right swipe to apply with a tailored resume or left swipe to skip using a Tinder-style card interface.

✉️ Cold Email Generator: Generates custom cold emails for selected job roles using portfolio matches and LLM assistance.

🔒 Authentication & Secure Deployment: API keys managed via .env, deployed on Streamlit Cloud/Vercel.
